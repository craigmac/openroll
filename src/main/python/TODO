2.0.0:
* Check that everything is working as intended.
* Make non-debug release and debug-enabled release

2.1.0:
* Create and place a widget spot for inserting flags
* Populate country dropdown list (default to Canada).
* Changing country index on dropdown changes flag image on scoreboard for that player.

TASKS:
* Read how to alter html/css of a QLabel widget programmatically.
*

2.2.0:
* Button to browse and load custom sound for alarm.

LATER:
* Allow manual flag images for competitors (e.g., flag of province, badge/sign of
department/unit (e.g., CAF/ US Marines)). Make sure the size is a certain resolution to
 enforce some consist look and feel on the scoreboard.
* Manual override for time: covers cases where you accidentally reset, you then
don't have to let timer run down to time it was at before the accident. Probably
use QInputDialog.getInteger()
* Log window of all scoring events during match with export function.
* Live toggleable debug window.
* don't allow closing scoreboard if parent still exists (Fix current hack of removing
close button on scoreboard for supported platforms to include any close event, e.g.,
coming from keyboard alt-f4 or system request to close).
* Make controls z-index higher than scoreboard so that it visible at startup.

PR IDEAS:
* Contact Canadian Army combatives to tell them about my program when released so they
could use it at CAFCombatives. "2019 Military Combatives Grappling Concentration"
* FB post
* FB page
* r/bjj
* r/pyside/2?
* openroll.sourceforge.io updates
* Show HN: openroll: my experience creating a pyside2 open-source application for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu tournaments
