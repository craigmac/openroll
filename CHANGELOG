2.0.2:
* BUG: pause/unpause now respects remaining time to next update ui call so
timer is accurate to real life stopwatch and uses a more finer grained
timer.
* UI updates - now have a play AND pause button separate, use LCD clock type
display for timer
* Huge overhaul and refactoring of code.

2.0.1:
* BUG: clicking test sound disabled play/pause until reset button pressed.
Removed that limitation.
* Dynamically linked build for LGPL compliance and easier releases
* Licenses files renamed and cleaned up LICENSES.txt file
* README reduced and simplified.

2.0.0:
* Huge speedboost on load
* Static build -- fewer files and size
* Portable now, no installer needed or admin priviledges--unzip and run.
* Many small bug fixes and build improvements working toward os x build and
release


2.0.0alpha:
* First test public release, to be followed by a beta release
and then a proper 2.0.0 production release.
* Installer created
* You are now able to load a custom logo for either competitor
* Sound mute/unmute working
