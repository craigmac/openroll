# Openroll

Openroll is a free and open-source scoreboard and match timer for IBJJF-rules
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It is not affiliated with the IBJJF in any way.

# Installation
Use the official pre-built binaries for your system, available at
[Sourceforge](https://openroll.sourceforge.io). If you simply want to use this
program, and not develop/alter it, this is all you need to do.

# Development
## Windows
To build on a Windows machine, you will need:

* Qt Creator 4.9.2+, which comes with Qt 5.12.4+ available from [Qt
  website](https://www.qt.io/download).
* MSVC 2017 64-bit Kit is used for Debug and Release builds in Qt Creator.

## Mac OS X
To build on OS X, you will need:

* XCode installed (free, from Apple, find it in the App Store).
* Qt Creator 4.9.2+, which comes with Qt 5.12.4+ available from [Qt
  website](https://www.qt.io/download).
* Build Debug/Release versions using default clang-64 kit.

## Linux/BSD Systems
To build on most linux/unix-based systems, you will need:

* Qt Creator 4.9.2+, which comes with Qt 5.12.4+ available from [Qt
  website](https://www.qt.io/download).
* Build Debug/Release versions using clang 64-bit kit (usually you must
install clang separately usually, unlike OS X, which comes with clang as part
of XCode)

## Troubleshooting Builds
Make sure first that you can build and run a Qt program by opening Qt Creator
and loading an example project. If you can't build it hopefully you'll be given
a hint as to what you need to do or what went wrong and you can Google the
error code/string. Troubleshooting building Openroll is outside the scope of
this document.
