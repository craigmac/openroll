Openroll is a free and open-source scoreboard and match timer for IBJJF-rules
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It is not affiliated with the IBJJF in any way.

# Installation
[![Download Openroll](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/sf-download-button)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openroll/files/latest/download)

# Development
To build debug and/or release builds on a Windows machine, you will need:

* Qt Creator 4.9.2+, which comes with Qt 5.12.4+ available from [Qt
  website](https://www.qt.io/download).
* If using the Qt online installer, choose the MinGW 64-bit Kit and install
the mingw64 build tools as well.

## Troubleshooting Builds
Make sure first that you can build and run a Qt program by opening Qt Creator
and loading an example project. If you can't build it hopefully you'll be given
a hint as to what you need to do or what went wrong and you can Google the
error code/string. Troubleshooting building Openroll is outside the scope of
this document.
