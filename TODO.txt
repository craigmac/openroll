New Code:
* Run cpplint over code and fix
* Adds documentation (style?)
* Write unit tests
* Allow loading custom sound file
*

Bugfix:
* Fix load up time by removing dynamically population of dropdown,
put it all in the control.ui file.
* When app starts pressing test sound doesn't work
* When you press sound test, the play button gets disabled, don't
do that.

Refactor:
* merge disable/enable functions into single function
* encapsulate match state into an enumeration? e.g.
    enum matchState {
        MATCH_STARTED = 0
        MATCH_STARTED_TIMER_STARTED_TIMER_RUNNING
        MATCH_STARTED_TIMER_STARTED_TIMER_PAUSED
        MATCH_STARTED_TIMER_STOPPED };
Figure out all combinations and switch on these easier rather than doing
bunch of && conditionals.
* divisionIdxToTimeMap[] is hacky, must be cleaner way to do that.
* controls.h : signals are not named uniformly
* Change all data members to 'm_varname' so they are uniform
